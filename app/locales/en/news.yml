    title: PeerTube 1.4 is out!
    date: September 25, 2019
    text:
      p1:
      - Hi everybody,
      - Peertube 1.4 just came out! Here’s a quick overview of what’s new…
      h4a: Plug-in system
      p2:
      - 'Since PeerTube’s launch, we have been aware that every administrator and user wishes to see the software fulfill their needs. As Framasoft cannot and will not develop every feature that could be hoped for, we have from the start of the project planned on creating a plug-in system.'
      - 'We are pleased to announce that the foundation stones of this system have been laid in this 1.4 release! It might be very basic for now, but we plan on improving it bit by bit in Peertube’s future releases.'
      - 'Now, this system allows each administrator to <b>create specific plug-ins</b> depending on their needs. They may install extensions created by other people on their instance as well. For example, it is now possible to install community created graphical themes to change the instance visual interface.'
      h4b: A better interface
      p3:
      - 'We strive to improve PeerTube’s interface by collecting users’ opinions so that we know what is causing them trouble (in terms of understanding and usability for example). Even though this is a time-consuming undertaking, this new release already offers you a few modifications.'
      - 'First of all, we realized that most people who discover PeerTube have a hard time understanding <b>the difference between a channel and an account</b>. Indeed, on others video broadcasting services (such as YouTube) these two things are pretty much the same.'
      - 'However, on PeerTube each account is linked to one or multiple channels that can be named as the users sees fit. You also have to create at least one channel when creating an account. Once the channels have been created, users can upload videos to each channel to organize their contents (for example, you could have a channel about cooking and another one about biking).'

          <figcaption>2 channels on Framasoft’s account on Framatube instance</figcaption>
        </figure>
      - 'In order to make this channel idea more understandable, we have changed the sign-up form, which from now on consists of two steps:'
      ul:
      - 'Step 1: account creation (choosing your username, password, email, etc.)'
      - 'Step 2: choosing your default channel name via a new form'
      p-img-signup:
      - <figure>

          <figcaption>the new sign-up form in 2 steps</figcaption>
        </figure>'
      ul2:
      - 'We also aimed to differentiate a channel homepage from that of an account. These two pages used to list videos, whereas now the account homepage lists all the channel linked to the account by showing under each channel name the thumbnail from the last videos uploaded on it.'
      - 'Another unclear element was the <b>video sharing pop-up</b>. We have improved it, and it is now possible to share or embed a video by making it start and/or finish at a precise moment (time-code feature), to decide which subtitles will appear by default, and to loop the video. These new options will surely be greatly enjoyed.'
      p-img-share:

        </figure>
      h4c: More features
      p4:
      - 'Our wonderful community of translators is once again to thank for their work, after they enriched PeerTube with <b>3 new languages</b>: Finnish, Greek and Scottish Gaelic, making PeerTube now available in 22 languages.'
      - 'We also added a new feature allowing you to <b>upload an audio file</b> directly to PeerTube: the software will automatically create a video from the audio file. This much awaited for feature should make life easier for music makers :)'
      - 'This new release includes many other improvements. You can see the complete list on <a href="@:data.link.gitPT/releases/tag/v1.4.0">@:data.link.gitPT/releases/tag/v1.4.0</a>.'
      - 'Thanks to all PeerTube contributors!<br>Framasoft'

    title: PeerTube 1.3 is out!
    date: June 5, 2019
    text:
      p:
      - Hello!
      - We’ve just released PeerTube 1.3 and it brings a lot of new features.
      - 'The most important of these new features is <strong>the playlist system</strong>.
        This feature allows any user to create a playlist in which it’s possible
        to add videos and reorder them. Videos added to a playlist can be viewed
        entirely or partially: the creator of the playlist can decide when the
        video playback starts and/or ends (timecode system). This system is really
        useful to create all kinds of zappings or educational contents by selecting
        extracts from videos which interest you. In addition, a “Watch Later”
        playlist is created by default for each user. Thus, you can save videos
        in this playlist when you don’t have time to watch them immediately.'
      - 'Another feature of this 1.3 version has been entirely developed by an
        external contributor: <a href="https://github.com/joshmorel">Josh Morel</a>
        who add <strong>a quarantine system</strong> for videos on PeerTube. If
        the administrator of an instance enables this feature, any new video uploaded
        on his instance will automatically be hidden until a moderator approves
        it.'
      - 'PeerTube translation community have done a huge job. <strong>3 new languages</strong>
        are now available: Japanese, Dutch and European Portuguese (PeerTube already
        support Brazilian Portuguese). Amazing! PeerTube is now available in 19
        languages!'
      - Now, administrators can <strong>manage more finely how other instances
        subscribe to their own instance</strong>. The administrator can decide whether
        or not to approve the subscription of another instance to its own. It is
        also possible to activate automatic rejection for any new subscription to
        its instance. Finally, a notification is created as soon as the administrator’s
        instance receives a new subscription. These features help administrators
        control on which instances their content is displayed.
      - We’re also redesigning the <strong>PeerTube video player</strong> to offer
        better video playback and to correct a few bugs. With this new player, resolution
        changes should be smoother and the bandwidth management is optimized with
        a more efficient buffering system. Version 1.3 of PeerTube also adds ability
        for administrators to enable this new experimental player so we can get
        feedback on it. We hope to use this new player by default in the future.
      - Finally, we have made some adjustments to the <strong>user interface</strong>
        so it easier and nicer to use. For instance, video thumbnails are becoming
        bigger so that they’re more highlighted. Users now have a quick access to
        their library from the menu that includes their playlists, videos, video
        watching history and their subscriptions.
      - Many other improvements have been made in this new version. You can see
        the complete list on <a href="@:data.link.gitPT/releases/tag/v1.3.0">@:data.link.gitPT/releases/tag/v1.3.0</a>.
      - Thanks to all PeerTube contributors!<br>Framasoft.

    title: 'PeerTube: retrospective, new features and more to come!'
    date: February 26, 2019
    text:
      p:
      - Since version 1.0 has been released last November, we went on improving
        PeerTube, day after day. These improvements on PeerTube go well beyond the
        objectives fixed during the crowdfunding. They have been funded by the <a
        href="@:data.link.soft">Framasoft non-profit</a>, which develops
        the software (and lives only through <a href="@:data.link.soutenir">your
        donations</a>).
      - 'Here is a small retrospective of the end of 2018/beginning of 2019:'
      - In December 2018, we released version 1.1 which contained some moderation
        tools requested by instance administrators.<br> We also took the opportunity
        to add a watched videos history feature and the automatic resuming of video
        playback.
      - 'In January, we released version 1.2 that supports 3 new languages: Russian,
        Polish and Italian. Thanks to PeerTube’s community of translators, PeerTube
        is now translated into 16 different languages!'
      - This version also includes a notification system that allows users to
        be informed (on the web interface or through email) when their video is
        commented, when someone mention them, when one of their subscriptions has
        published a new video, etc.
      - 'In the meantime, the PeerTube federation has grown: today, more than
        300 instances broadcast more than 70,000 videos, with nearly 2 million cumulated
        views. We remind you that the only official website we maintain around PeerTube
        is <a href="@:data.link.joinpeertube">@:data.link.joinpeertube</a>
        and that we bear no responsibility on any other site that may be published.'
      - As you can see, we have gone far beyond what the crowdfunding has funded.
        And we will continue!<br> For 2019, we plan to add a plugin and theme management
        system (even though basic at first), playlist management, support for audio
        files upload and many other features.
      - 'If you also to contribute to the growing of PeerTube, you can participate
        in its funding here: @:data.html.soutenir'
      - 'If you have any questions, feel free to use <a href="@:link.forumPT">our forum</a>.'
      - Thank you and with our best regards,<br>Framasoft

        like to thank you one more time, for allowing us to greatly improve PeerTube,
        and therefore to promote a more decentralized web. But the journey does
        not end here: we will continue to work on the software, and there is still
        a lot to do to fully free up video streaming. But before anything, we’ll
        take a few days off ;)'

      - Hello everyone!
      - A month before the version 1 of PeerTube, we would like to share some
        (good!) news with you.
      - We just released PeerTube <em>beta 12</em>, that allows to subscribe to
        video channels, whether they are on your instance or even on remote instances.
        This way, you can browse videos of your subscribed channels in a dedicated
        page. Moreover, if your PeerTube administrator allows it, you can search
        a channel or a video directly by typing their web address in the PeerTube
        search bar.
      - It was not included in the crowdfunding, but we created an “Overview”
        page, that displays videos of some categories/tags/channels picked randomly,
        to show the diversity of the videos uploaded on PeerTube. You can see <a
        href="https://peertube3.cpy.re/videos/overview">a demonstration here</a>.
      - You can read the complete <em>beta 12</em> changelog <a href="@:data.link.gitPT/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#v100-beta12">here</a>.
      - 'Regarding the crowdfunding, most of the rewards are ready: <a href="
        @:data.link.gitPT">the PeerTube README</a> and <a
        href="@:data.baseurl/hall-of-fame">the JoinPeerTube Hall
        of Fame</a> show off the names of the persons who have chosen the corresponding
        rewards. We will soon be able to send the personalized thank-you digital
        arts to people that gave 80€ (~93 USD) and more (and it’s so beautiful
        that we are looking forward to it!)'
      - The last feature we have to implement is the videos redundancy between
        instances, which will further increase resilience on instance overload.
        If all goes well, we should finish it in about two weeks (end of september).
      - We remind you that you can track the progress of the work directly <a
        href="@:data.link.gitPT"> on the git repository</a>,
        and be part of the discussions/bug reports/feature requests in the “Issues”
        tab.
      - Moreover, you can ask questions on <a href="@:link.forumPT">the
        PeerTube forum</a>. You can also contact us directly on @:data.hlink.contact</>.

      - Hello everyone!
      - The development of the crowdfunding features is going well.
      - As a reminder, in the first newsletter (July 23rd, 2018), we announced
        that the localization system and RSS feeds were implemented, and that we
        were making progress on the subtitles support and the advanced search.
      - These four features are all implemented, and can already be used on instances
        updated to version <em>v1.0.0-beta.10</em> (for example @:data.html.tube).
        Regarding the subtitles support, you can test them on the <a href="https://framatube.org/videos/watch/217eefeb-883d-45be-b7fc-a788ad8507d3">
        the “What is PeerTube”</a> video.
      - We are currently finishing the video import system, from a URL (YouTube,
        Vimeo etc) or a torrent file. This feature should be available in a few
        days, when we will release a new version (<em>v1.0.0-beta.11</em>).<br>
        The import system will complete the first crowdfunding goal. The next feature
        we will be working on will be the user subscriptions.
      - We remind you that you can track the progress of the work directly <a
        href="@:data.link.gitPT"> on the git repository</a>,
        and be part of the discussions/bug reports/feature requests in the “Issues”
        tab.
      - Moreover, you can ask questions on <a href="@:link.forumPT">the
        PeerTube forum</a>. You can also contact us directly on @:data.hlink.contact</>.

      - Hello everyone!
      - First of all, thank you again for contributing to PeerTube! ❤️
      - 'During the crowdfunding campaign, we continued to work on the localization
        system. And we are happy to announce it’s finally completed: it will be
        available in the next beta (<em>beta 10</em>) of PeerTube. As of this
        writing, the web interface is already available in english, french, basque,
        catalan, czech and esperanto (huge thank you to <a href="@:data.link.gitPT/blob/develop/CREDITS.md#translations"
        > all of the translators</a>). If you too want to help translating PeerTube,
        do not hesitate to check out <a href="@:data.link.gitPT/blob/develop/support/doc/translation.md"
        >the documentation</a>!'
      - Regarding the RSS feeds feature, it was already implemented by <a href="https://github.com/rigelk">Rigelk</a>
        and you can already use it in the <em>beta 9</em>. You can, for example,
        get <a href="https://framatube.org/feeds/videos.xml?sort=-publishedAt&filter=local">
        the feed of the last local videos uploaded in a particular instance</a>.
      - Subtitles support is well under way, and we should have a first version
        available soon. When this work is finished, we will develop the advanced
        search.
      - We remind you that you can track the progress of the work directly <a
        href="@:data.link.gitPT"> on the git repository</a>,
        and be part of the discussions/bug reports/feature requests in the "Issues"
