        rules: it’s a network of dozens of interconnected hosting providers, and each
        provider is composed of different people and administrators. You don’t like
        some of the rules? You’re free to join the hosting provider of your choice,
        or even better, be your own hosting provider with your own rules!'

      desc: PeerTube allows you to share all your videos. Being in direct contact
        with a human hosting provider (or becoming your own) allows you to choose
        how their broadcasting is done. Your videos will benefit from tools to fill
        description, categorization, choosing a preview image and marking videos as
        not safe for work. Tweaking the <strong>Support</strong> button will allow
        you to show your audience how you want them to support your work.

      desc: When you watch a video with PeerTube, the WebTorrent technology allows
        you to be part of the broadcasting of this video with the viewers who are
        watching it at the same time. This video stream sharing allows a healthier
        distribution of exchanges on the network. Moreover, the federation protocol
        (ActivityPub) allows to publish the videos and comments on other platforms
        that support it, such as <a href="@:data.link.mastodon">Mastodon</a>! (experimental)

    how:
      title: How it works
      text:
      - Everybody can host a PeerTube server we call <strong>instance</strong>. Every
        instance hosts its own users and their videos. It also keeps a list of the
        videos available of the instances the administrator chooses to follow in order
        to suggest them to its users.
      - Every account has a globally unique identifier (e.g. @chocobozzz@framatube.org)
        consisting of the local username (@chocobozzz) and the domain name of the
        server it is on (framatube.org).
      - The administrators of a PeerTube instance can follow each other. When your
        PeerTube instance follows another PeerTube instance, you receive the videos'
        preview information from this instance. This way, you can display the videos
        available on your instance and on the instances you decided to follow. So
        you keep control of the videos displayed on your PeerTube instance!

    why:
      title: Why is that cool?
      text:
      - Servers are run independently by different people and organizations. They
        can apply wildly different moderation policies, so you can find or make one
        that fits your taste perfectly.
      - By watching a video, you help the hosting provider to broadcast it by becoming
        a broadcaster of the video yourself. Each instance doesn’t need much money
        to broadcast the videos of its users.

    what:
      title: What is PeerTube?
      text:
      - PeerTube is software that you install on a web server. It allows you to create
        a video hosting website, so create your "homemade YouTube".
      - The difference to YouTube is that it’s not intended to create a huge platform
        centralizing videos from the whole world on a single server farm (which is
        horribly expensive).
      - On the contrary, PeerTube’s concept is to create a network of multiple small
        interconnected video hosting providers.
    pros:
      title: The three main advantages of PeerTube.
      text:
      - 'PeerTube is unique because (as far as we know) it’s the only video hosting
        web application which combines three advantages:'
      - Linked together, these three features makes it easy to host videos on the
        server side, while remaining practical, ethical and fun for the internet users.
      list:
      - An open code (transparency) under a free/libre license (ethic, respect and
        community-driven development);
      - A federation of interconnected hosting providers (so more video choices wherever
        you go to see them);
      - Peer-to-peer broadcasting – and therefore viewing – (so no slowing down when
        a video becomes viral).
    libre:
      title: Why is it better as free/libre software?
      text:
      - Because by design free/libre software respects our fundamental freedoms, and
        guarantees them by <a href="@:data.link.gitPT/blob/develop/LICENSE">a license</a>,
        so a legally enforceable contract.
      - 'Concretely here, it means that:'
      list:
      - PeerTube is freely provided, no need to pay to install it on your server;
      - 'We can look under the hood of PeerTube (its source code): it’s auditable,
        transparent;'
      - Its development is community-based, it can be enhanced by everyone’s contributions.
    federated:
      title: What’s the interest to federate the video hosting providers?
      text:
      - 'The advantage of YouTube (and other platforms) is its video catalog: from
        knitting tutorials to Minecraft constructions through videos of kittens or
        holidays… you can find everything!'
      - The more the video catalogue is varied, the more people are interested, the
        more videos are uploaded… but hosting videos from all over the world is (very,
        very) expensive!
      - If the hosting provider Knitting-PeerTube becomes friends with Kittens-Tube
        and Framatube, it will display the videos of others on its site, thus diluting
        hosting costs while remaining practical and complete for Internet users.
      - 'PeerTube’s federation protocol will be fluid (everyone can choose their "friends"
        hosts), and based on <a href="@:data.link.activitypub">ActivityPub</a>: this
        will open the possibility to connect with tools like Mastodon or MediaGoblin.'
    p2p:
      title: Why broadcast PeerTube videos through peer-to-peer?
      text:
      - 'When you host a large file like a video, the biggest thing to fear is success:
        if a video becomes viral and many people watch it at the same time, the server
        has a big risk of getting overloaded!'
      - Peer-to-peer broadcasting allows, thanks to the <a href="@:link.wArticle/WebRTC">WebRTC</a>
        protocol, that Internet users who watch the same video at the same time exchange
        bits of files, which relieves the server.
      - 'There is nothing to do: your web browser does it automatically. If you are
        on a mobile phone or if your network does not allow it (router, firewall,
        etc.), this function is disabled and switches back to an "old-style" video
        broadcast @:data.emoji.wink</>.'
    admin:
      title: For those who know how to administer a server, PeerTube is…
      text:
      - '<strong>It’s software you install on your server</strong> to create a website
        where videos are hosted and broadcast… Basically: you create your own "homemade
        YouTube"!'
      - There already exists free/libre software that enables you to do this. But
        with PeerTube, you can link your instance (your video website) to Zaïd’s PeerTube
        instance (where he hosts videos of the lectures for his people’s university),
        to Catherin’s (who hosts her webmedia videos) or even to Solar’s PeerTube
        instance (who manages a vloggers collective).
      - '<strong>But PeerTube doesn’t centralize: it federates.</strong> Thanks to
        the <a href="@:data.link.activitypub">ActivityPub</a> protocol (also used
        by <a href="@:data.link.mastodon">the Mastodon federation</a>, a free/libre
        Twitter alternative), PeerTube can federate several small hosters so they
        don’t have to buy thousands of hard disks to host videos for the whole world.'
      - As a result, on your PeerTube website, the audience will be able to watch
        not only your videos, but also videos hosted by Zaïd, Catherin or Solar… without
        having to host their videos on your PeerTube-powered website. Such diversity
        in a video-catalog makes it very attractive. Such a large choice and diversity
        of videos is what made centralized platforms such as YouTube succesful.
      - 'Federation offers another benefit: <strong>everyone becomes independent</strong>.
        Zaïd, Catherin, Solar and yourself can make your own rules, your own Terms
        of Services (for example, one can imagine a MeowTube where dogs videos are
        strictly forbidden @:data.emoji.wink).'
    video-maker:
      title: For those who wants to upload their videos, PeerTube allows…
      text:
      - 'It allows you to choose a hoster that fits you. YouTube’s excesses are a
        good exemple: its hoster, Google/Alphabet, can impose its "Robocopyright"
        (the ContentID system) or its tools to index, recommend and spotlight videos;
        and those tools seem as unfair as they are obscure. Even though, it already
        forces you <a href="@:data.link.tosdr">to give it extended copyrights on your
        videos, for free</a>!'
      - With PeerTube, <strong>you can choose the hoster of your videos according
        to his terms of services</strong>, his moderation policy, his federation choices…
        As you don’t have a tech giant facing you, you might be able to talk with
        you hoster if you ever have a problem, a need, or something you want.
      - The other big advantage of PeerTube is that your hoster doesn’t have to fear
        the sudden success of one of your videos. Indeed, PeerTube broadcasts videos
        with the protocol <a href="@:link.wArticle/BitTorrent">WebTorrent</a>. If
        hundreds of people are watching your video at the same time, their browsers
        automatically send bits of your video to other viewers.
      - Before this peer-to-peer broadcast, successful videographers (or videos that
        make the buzz) were doomed to be hosted by a web giant whose infrastructure
        can handle millions of simultaneous views… Or to pay for a very expensive
        independent video host so that it can hold the load.
    audience:
      title: For those who want to watch videos, PeerTube can offer…
      text:
      - One of the benefits is that <strong>you become a part of the broadcasting
        of the videos you are watching</strong>. If other people are watching a PeerTube
        video at the same time as you, as long as your tab remains open, your browser
        shares bits of that video and you participate in a healthier use of the Internet.
      - 'Of course, PeerTube’s video player adapts to your situation: if your installation
        does not allow peer-to-peer playback (corporate network, recalcitrant browser,
        etc.) video playback will be done in the classic way.'
      - But above all, <strong>PeerTube treats you like a person, not as a product</strong>
        that it has to track, profile, and lock in video loops to better sell your
        available brain time. Thus, the <a href="@:data.link.gitPT">source code</a>
        (the recipe) of the PeerTube software is open, making its operation transparent.
      - '<strong>PeerTube is not only open-source: it’s free (as in free speech).</strong>
        Its free license guarantees our fundamental freedoms as users. It is this
        respect for our freedoms that allows Framasoft to invite you to contribute
        to this software, and many evolutions (innovative comment system, etc.) have
        already been suggested by some of you.'
    remplace-yt:
      title: Is PeerTube’s purpose to replace YouTube?
      text:
      - 'We can answer with certainty: no!'
      - In March 2018, PeerTube released its publicly usable beta version. Several
        collectives set up the first instances, thus creating the bases of the federation.
      - But this is just the beginning, PeerTube is not (yet) perfect, and many features
        are missing. But we intend to keep improving it day after day.
      - 'March 2018 thus represents the birth of the PeerTube federations: the more
        this software will be used and supported, the more people will use it and
        contribute to it, and the faster it will evolve towards a concrete alternative
        to platforms such as YouTube.'
      - 'Nevertheless, the ambition remains to be <strong>a free and decentralized
        alternative</strong>: the goal of an alternative is not to replace, but to
        propose something else, with different values, in parallel to what already
        exists.'
  content:
    law:
      title: If it’s free, can we upload illegal stuff on it?
      text:
      - Being free doesn’t mean being above the law! Each PeerTube hosting provider
        can decide on its own general conditions of use, abiding by their local laws.
      - For example, in France, discriminatory content <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_contre_le_racisme_et_les_discours_de_haine">is
        prohibited</a> and may be <a href="http://stop-discrimination.gouv.fr/agir/ne-pas-laisser-faire-les-recours">reported
        to the authorities</a>. PeerTube allows users to report problematic videos,
        and each administrator must then apply its moderation in accordance with its
        terms and conditions and the law.
      - The federation system, for its part, allows hosts to decide with whom they
        want to connect, depending on the types of content or the moderation policies
        of others.
    responsible:
      title: Who is responsible for content published on PeerTube?
      text:
      - 'PeerTube is not a website: it is software that allows a web hoster (for example,
        Dominique) to create a video website (let’s call it DominiqueTube).'
      - Now imagine that Camille has created an account on DominiqueTube and uploads
        an illegal video, because this video uses music created by Solal.
      - Solal goes on Framatube, an instance which follows DominiqueTube. So, Solal
        can see, from Framatube, the videos published on DominiqueTube.
      - Solal sees Camille’s illegal video, and signals it with the button provided
        for that purpose. Although the report is made from Framatube, it is sent directly
        to the person hosting the illegal content, Dominique.
      - From that moment on, Dominique is responsible, because they are warned that
        they’re hosting an illegal video. It is therefore up to them to act if they
        don’t want to be held accountable before the law.
      - Then Dominique and Solal can turn against Camille, who uploaded the video.
    money:
      title: What is PeerTube’s remuneration policy?
      text:
      - OrderedDict([('There are none, not at the moment', 'PeerTube is a tool that
        we wanted neutral in terms of remuneration.')])
      - 'For now, the solution proposed to people who upload videos is to use the
        "support" button under the video. This button displays a frame in which people
        who upload videos can display text, images, and links freely. For example,
        it’s possible to put a link to Patreon, Tipeee, Paypal, Liberapay (or any
        other solution) there. Other examples: put a postal address if you’d like
        to receive physical thank-you cards, put a logo of your enterprise, a link
        to support a non-profit organisation…'
      - We did not go any further because to favour one technical solution would be
        to impose, in the code, a political vision of cultural sharing and its financing.
        All financial solutions are possible and treated equally in PeerTube.
      - However, many improvements of PeerTube are to be expected… Including those
        that would allow you to create (and choose) the monetization tools that interest
        you!
      - 'Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that the vast majority of videos published
        on the Internet (and even on YouTube) are shared for non-market purposes:
        remuneration is a tool, but not necessarily a main or essential purpose.'
    instances:
      title: Where can I put my videos?
      text:
      - You need to find a PeerTube hosting instance you trust.
      - There’s a complete <a href="@:data.link.instancesPT">list of instances here</a>,
        and a list of those that are <a href="./#getting-started">open to registration
        here</a>.
      - Then, we recommend you go to the instances, read their "about" page to discover
        their terms of use (disk space limit per user, content policy, etc.).
      - It’s best to contact and talk directly with hosting providers, to understand
        their business model, vision, etc. Because only you can determine what makes
        you trust such or such host, and thus entrust your videos to them.
    pornography:
      title: There are many porn videos on PeerTube!
      text:
      - No. In October 2018, on an average instance federating with ~200 instances
        and indexing ~16000 videos, only ~200 videos are tagged as NSFW (i. e. the
        content is sensitive, which could be something else than pornography). Therefore,
        they represent only ~1% of all the videos.
      - 'Moreover, each administrator decides with which instances he wants to federate:
        he has the full control of the content he wants to display on his instance.
        It''s up to him to choose the policy regarding this kind of videos. He can
        decide to: <ul><li>Display them</li><li>Blur the title and thumbnail</li><li>Hide
        them</li></ul>'
      - By default, this configuration is set to "Hide them". If some administrators
        decide to display them with a blur filter for example, it's <strong>their</strong>
        choice.
      - Finally, any user can override this configuration, and decides if he want
        to display, blur or hide these videos for himself.
      - 'PeerTube is just a software: it''s not Framasoft (non-profit that develops
        PeerTube) that''s responsible for the content published on some instances.'
      - 'It''s up to everyone to be responsible: parents, visitors, uploaders, PeerTube
        administrators to respect the law and avoid any problematic situations.'

      title: How do I install PeerTube?
      text:
      - The <a href="@:data.link.gitPT/blob/develop/support/doc/production.md">installation
        guide is here</a> (only in English, for the moment).
      - 'We recommend not to install PeerTube on low-end hardware or behind a weak
        connection (for example, on a RaspberryPi with an ADSL connection): this could
        slow down all federations.'
      - 'Don’t bother the developer to help you install your instance: we have a <a
        href="@:link.forumPT">support forum</a> for that.'
    moderation:
      title: PeerTube v1.0 does not seem to me to contain all the tools necessary
        for a good management of my instance.
      text:
      - '<blockquote>"It’s outrageous and unconscious: you’re releasing PeerTube’s
        version 1 when it doesn’t contain the necessary tools to effectively manage
        videos claimed by rights holders, or to effectively manage the issue of online
        harassment in comments, or to effectively manage monetization through advertising,
        or to (insert here your request to PeerTube). It will never work! What do
        you intend to do about it?"</blockquote>'
      - You’re right. PeerTube 1.0 is not the perfect tool, far from it. And we never
        promised that this version 1.0 would be a tool that would include all the
        features corresponding to all cases.
      - PeerTube 1.0 is the realization of the commitment we made in October 2017
        to take PeerTube from an alpha version (personal project and proof of concept
        that a federated video platform could work) to a 1.0 version in October 2018
        (which does not mean "final version", but "version considered stable and distributable").
      - Remember that PeerTube has only one (almost) full time developer and a small
        handful of very involved volunteers. It is not a product developed by a start-up
        with a full time team (dev, design, UX, marketing, support, etc.) and significant
        financial support. It is a Community free software, the development of which
        will continue over the months and, we hope, in the years to come.
      - 'We are well aware of the shortcomings of PeerTube 1.0, especially in the
        moderation tools area (videos, comments, etc.). And we intend to work on these
        weaknesses. '
      - 'We have chosen to do so as follows: on the one hand we will work primarily
        in the coming months to improve these tools within PeerTube itself (in the
        <i>core</i> of the software). On the other hand, we will also focus, in parallel,
        a large part of PeerTube’s development effort during 2019 on the integration
        of a plugin system, which can be developed by the communities.'
      - 'Indeed, we do not claim to have the science behind it and know how best to
        manage each of the tools according to each of the needs. For example: with
        regard to the question of DMCA requests, cases vary according to geographical
        jurisdictions (European law is different from French law, itself different
        from Canadian law, itself different from American law, etc.). Concerning the
        tools for moderating comments, here again, we cannot decree ourselves experts
        of the subject, because this is simply not the case.'
      - By acting both on the <i>core</i>, but also by allowing the development of
        plugins, we believe that PeerTube will, in the long term, be able to respond
        much better to these issues and allow different communities to adapt PeerTube
        to their needs.
      - We are working as quickly as possible to improve PeerTube, but we are doing
        so with the resources we have, which means <strong>very</strong> limited.
      - 'In the meantime, as an user if you feel that PeerTube 1.0 does not currently
        meet your needs, it’s simple: don’t use it right now :) (we remind you that
        we don’t make money developing PeerTube, and that if we obviously hope for

      title: Why does PeerTube use the ActivityPub federation protocol? Why not IPFS
        / d.tube / Steemit?
      text:
      - PeerTube uses ActivityPub because this federation protocol is recommended
        by the W3C and is already used by the federated social network Mastodon.
      - IPFS is a great technology, but it still seems very (too!) young for large
        scale streaming of large files.
      - After discussing it on our forum, we feel that d.tube is not free or open
        source, because publishing only compiled code hinders freedom of modification.
      - D.tube is based on Steem for "remuneration", it is a choice, but Steem is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steemit#Criticism">widely criticized</a>
        as <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@docdelux/30-days-of-steemit-here-is-my-criticism">highly
        centralized</a>, and suspiciously <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@thecryptonews/psa-constructive-criticism-the-ugly-truth-behind-steemit">resembles
        a Ponzi system</a>.
      - PeerTube is free, decentralized, distributed, and does not impose any remuneration
        model. This is the choice we have made, which is debatable, and others (like
        d.tube) have made other choices, which have their advantages. So it’s up to
        you to see what suits you.

      title: PeerTube 1.3 is out!

        p1: Hello!
        p2: We've just released PeerTube 1.3 and it brings a lot of new features.
        p3: 'The most important of these new features is <strong>the playlist system</strong>.
          This feature allows any user to create a playlist in which it''s possible
          to add videos and reorder them. Videos added to a playlist can be viewed
          entirely or partially: the creator of the playlist can decide when the video
          playback starts and/or ends (timecode system). This system is really useful
          to create all kinds of zappings or educational contents by selecting extracts
          from videos which interest you. In addition, a "Watch Later" playlist is
          created by default for each user. Thus, you can save videos in this playlist
          when you don''t have time to watch them immediately.'
        p4: 'Another feature of this 1.3 version has been entirely developed by an
          external contributor: <a href="https://github.com/joshmorel">Josh Morel</a>
          who add <strong>a quarantine system</strong> for videos on PeerTube. If
          the administrator of an instance enables this feature, any new video uploaded
          on his instance will automatically be hidden until a moderator approves
          it.'
        p5: 'PeerTube translation community have done a huge job. <strong>3 new languages</strong>
          are now available: Japanese, Dutch and European Portuguese (PeerTube already
          support Brazilian Portuguese). Amazing! PeerTube is now available in 19
          languages!'
        p6: Now, administrators can <strong>manage more finely how other instances
          subscribe to their own instance</strong>. The administrator can decide whether
          or not to approve the subscription of another instance to its own. It is
          also possible to activate automatic rejection for any new subscription to
          its instance. Finally, a notification is created as soon as the administrator's
          instance receives a new subscription. These features help administrators
          control on which instances their content is displayed.
        p7: We're also redesigning the <strong>PeerTube video player</strong> to offer
          better video playback and to correct a few bugs. With this new player, resolution
          changes should be smoother and the bandwidth management is optimized with
          a more efficient buffering system. Version 1.3 of PeerTube also adds ability
          for administrators to enable this new experimental player so we can get
          feedback on it. We hope to use this new player by default in the future.
        p8: Finally, we have made some adjustments to the <strong>user interface</strong>
          so it easier and nicer to use. For instance, video thumbnails are becoming
          bigger so that they're more highlighted. Users now have a quick access to
          their library from the menu that includes their playlists, videos, video
          watching history and their subscriptions.
        p9: Many other improvements have been made in this new version. You can see
          the complete list on <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/releases/tag/v1.3.0">https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/releases/tag/v1.3.0</a>.
        p10: Thanks to all PeerTube contributors!

        p1: Since version 1.0 has been released last November, we went on improving
          PeerTube, day after day. These improvements on PeerTube go well beyond the
          objectives fixed during the crowdfunding. They have been funded by the <a
          href="https://framasoft.org/en/">Framasoft non-profit</a>, which develops
          the software (and lives only through <a href="https://soutenir.framasoft.org/en/">your
          donations</a>).
        p2: 'Here is a small retrospective of the end of 2018/beginning of 2019:'
        p3: In December 2018, we released version 1.1 which contained some moderation
          tools requested by instance administrators.<br> We also took the opportunity
          to add a watched videos history feature and the automatic resuming of video
          playback.
        p4: 'In January, we released version 1.2 that supports 3 new languages: Russian,
          Polish and Italian. Thanks to PeerTube''s community of translators, PeerTube
          is now translated into 16 different languages!'
        p5: This version also includes a notification system that allows users to
          be informed (on the web interface or through email) when their video is
          commented, when someone mention them, when one of their subscriptions has
          published a new video, etc.
        p6: 'In the meantime, the PeerTube federation has grown: today, more than
          300 instances broadcast more than 70,000 videos, with nearly 2 million cumulated
          views. We remind you that the only official website we maintain around PeerTube
          is <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/en">https://joinpeertube.org/en</a>
          and that we bear no responsibility on any other site that may be published.'
        p7: As you can see, we have gone far beyond what the crowdfunding has funded.
          And we will continue!<br> For 2019, we plan to add a plugin and theme management
          system (even though basic at first), playlist management, support for audio
          files upload and many other features.
        p8: 'If you also to contribute to the growing of PeerTube, you can participate
          in its funding here: <a href="https://soutenir.framasoft.org/en">https://soutenir.framasoft.org/en</a>'

        p1: Hello everyone!
        p2: We are now in mid-October! As promised, we have just released the first
          stable version of PeerTube.
        p3: 'It implements all stretch goals we planned in our crowdfunding: <ul><li>Localization
          support (as we write these lines, PeerTube is already available in 13 different
          languages!)</li> <li>Subtitles support</li> <li>Ability to import videos
          through an URL (YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion and many others!)</li> <li>Ability
          to import a video through a torrent file or a magnet URI</li> <li>RSS feeds,
          allowing you to track new videos published in all federated PeerTube instances,
          in a specific PeerTube instance or in a video channel you like. You can
          also subscribe to comment feeds!</li> <li>A more relevant search, with the
          ability to set advanced filters (duration, category, tags...)</li> <li>Subscriptions
          throughout the federation: you can follow your favorite video channels and
          see all the videos on a dedicated page</li> <li>Redundancy system: a PeerTube
          instance can help sharing some videos from another instance</li> </ul>'
        p4: ' We know that feature descriptions are not very amusing, so we have published
          a few demonstration videos: <ul> <li><a href="https://framatube.org/videos/watch/f57da309-6b92-4fe0-9267-ff8188cc050c">RSS

        p1: Hello everyone!
        p2: A month before the version 1 of PeerTube, we would like to share some
          (good!) news with you.
        p3: We just released PeerTube <em>beta 12</em>, that allows to subscribe to
          video channels, whether they are on your instance or even on remote instances.
          This way, you can browse videos of your subscribed channels in a dedicated
          page. Moreover, if your PeerTube administrator allows it, you can search
          a channel or a video directly by typing their web address in the PeerTube
          search bar.
        p4: It was not included in the crowdfunding, but we created an "Overview"
          page, that displays videos of some categories/tags/channels picked randomly,
          to show the diversity of the videos uploaded on PeerTube. You can see <a
          href="https://peertube3.cpy.re/videos/overview">a demonstration here</a>.
        p5: You can read the complete <em>beta 12</em> changelog <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#v100-beta12">here</a>.
        p6: 'Regarding the crowdfunding, most of the rewards are ready: <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube">the
          PeerTube README</a> and <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/fr/hall-of-fame/">the
          JoinPeerTube Hall of Fame</a> show off the names of the persons who have
          chosen the corresponding rewards. We will soon be able to send the personalized
          thank-you digital arts to people that gave 80€ (~93 USD) and more (and it''s
          so beautiful that we are looking forward to it!)'
        p7: The last feature we have to implement is the videos redundancy between
          instances, which will further increase resilience on instance overload.
          If all goes well, we should finish it in about two weeks (end of september).
        p8: We remind you that you can track the progress of the work directly <a
          href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube"> on the git repository</a>,
          and be part of the discussions/bug reports/feature requests in the "Issues"

        p1: Hello everyone!
        p2: The development of the crowdfunding features is going well.
        p3: As a reminder, in the first newsletter (July 23rd, 2018), we announced
          that the localization system and RSS feeds were implemented, and that we
          were making progress on the subtitles support and the advanced search.
        p4: These four features are all implemented, and can already be used on instances
          updated to version <em>v1.0.0-beta.10</em> (for example <a href="https://framatube.org">https://framatube.org</a>).
          Regarding the subtitles support, you can test them on the <a href="https://framatube.org/videos/watch/217eefeb-883d-45be-b7fc-a788ad8507d3">
          the "What is PeerTube"</a> video.
        p5: We are currently finishing the video import system, from a URL (YouTube,
          Vimeo etc) or a torrent file. This feature should be available in a few
          days, when we will release a new version (<em>v1.0.0-beta.11</em>).<br>
          The import system will complete the first crowdfunding goal. The next feature
          we will be working on will be the user subscriptions.
        p6: We remind you that you can track the progress of the work directly <a
