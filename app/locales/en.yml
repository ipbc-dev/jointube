      title: Take back the power… and the responsibilities!
      desc: 'PeerTube isn’t a single video hosting platform with a single group of
        rules: it’s a network of dozens of interconnected hosting providers, and each
        provider is composed of different people and administrators. You don’t like
        some of the rules? You’re free to join the hosting provider of your choice,
        or even better, be your own hosting provider with your own rules!'
    content:
      title: Take control of your content
      desc: PeerTube allows you to share all your videos. Being in direct contact
        with a human hosting provider (or becoming your own) allows you to choose
        how their broadcasting is done. Your videos will benefit from tools to fill
        description, categorization, choosing a preview image and marking videos as
        not safe for work. Tweaking the <strong>Support</strong> button will allow
        you to show your audience how you want them to support your work.

      title: Putting the users first
      desc: 'You’re a person, not a product. PeerTube is a free/libre software financed
        by a French non-profit organization: @:data.html.soft</>. All instances are
        created, animated, moderated and maintained independently. PeerTube isn’t
        submitted by any company monopole, doesn’t depend on ads and doesn’t track
        you. With PeerTube you’re not a product: PeerTube is at your service, not
        the other way around.'
    broadcast:
      title: Become an actor of your videos broadcasting
      desc: When you watch a video with PeerTube, the WebTorrent technology allows
        you to be part of the broadcasting of this video with the viewers who are
        watching it at the same time. This video stream sharing allows a healthier
        distribution of exchanges on the network. Moreover, the federation protocol
        (ActivityPub) allows to publish the videos and comments on other platforms
        that support it, such as <a href="@:data.link.mastodon">Mastodon</a>! (experimental)

    how:
      title: How it works
      text:
      - Everybody can host a PeerTube server we call <strong>instance</strong>. Every
        instance hosts its own users and their videos. It also keeps a list of the
        videos available of the instances the administrator chooses to follow in order
        to suggest them to its users.
      - Every account has a globally unique identifier (e.g. @chocobozzz@framatube.org)
        consisting of the local username (@chocobozzz) and the domain name of the
        server it is on (framatube.org).
      - The administrators of a PeerTube instance can follow each other. When your
        PeerTube instance follows another PeerTube instance, you receive the videos
        preview informations from this instance. This way, you can display the videos
        available on your instance and on the instances you decided to follow. So
        you keep control of the videos displayed on your PeerTube instance!

    why:
      title: Why is that cool?
      text:
      - Servers are run independently by different people and organizations. They
        can apply wildly different moderation policies, so you can find or make one
        that fits your taste perfectly.
      - By watching a video, you help the hosting provider to broadcast it by becoming
        a broadcaster of the video yourself. Each instance doesn’t need much money
        to broadcast the videos of its users.

    what:
      title: What is PeerTube?
      text:
      - PeerTube is software that you install on a web server. It allows you to create
        a video hosting website, so create your "homemade YouTube".
      - The difference to YouTube is that it’s not intended to create a huge platform
        centralizing videos from the whole world on a single server farm (which is
        horribly expensive).
      - On the contrary, PeerTube’s concept is to create a network of multiple small
        interconnected video hosting providers.
    pros:
      title: The three main advantages of PeerTube.
      text:
      - 'PeerTube is unique because (as far as we know) it’s the only video hosting
        web application which combines three advantages:'
      - Linked together, these three features makes it easy to host videos on the
        server side, while remaining practical, ethical and fun for the internet users.
      list:
      - An open code (transparency) under a free/libre license (ethic, respect and
        community-driven development);
      - A federation of interconnected hosting providers (so more video choices wherever
        you go to see them);
      - Peer-to-peer broadcasting – and therefore viewing – (so no slowing down when
        a video becomes viral).
    libre:
      title: Why is it better as free/libre software?
      text:
      - Because by design free/libre software respects our fundamental freedoms, and
        guarantees them by <a href="@:data.link.gitPT/blob/develop/LICENSE">a license</a>,
        so a legally enforceable contract.
      - 'Concretely here, it means that:'
      list:
      - PeerTube is freely provided, no need to pay to install it on your server;
      - 'We can look under the hood of PeerTube (its source code): it’s auditable,
        transparent;'
      - Its development is community-based, it can be enhanced by everyone’s contributions.
    federated:
      title: What’s the interest to federate the video hosting providers?
      text:
      - 'The advantage of YouTube (and other platforms) is its video catalog: from
        knitting tutorials to Minecraft constructions through videos of kittens or
        holidays… you can find everything!'
      - The more the video catalogue is varied, the more people are interested, the
        more videos are uploaded… but hosting videos from all over the world is (very,
        very) expensive!
      - If the hosting provider Knitting-PeerTube becomes friends with Kittens-Tube
        and Framatube, it will display the videos of others on its site, thus diluting
        hosting costs while remaining practical and complete for Internet users.
      - 'PeerTube’s federation protocol will be fluid (everyone can choose their "friends"
        hosts), and based on <a href="@:data.link.activitypub">ActivityPub</a>: this
        will open the possibility to connect with tools like Mastodon or MediaGoblin.'
    p2p:
      title: Why broadcast PeerTube videos through peer-to-peer?
      text:
      - 'When you host a large file like a video, the biggest thing to fear is success:
        if a video becomes viral and many people watch it at the same time, the server
        has a big risk of getting overloaded!'
      - Peer-to-peer broadcasting allows, thanks to the <a href="@:link.wArticle/WebRTC">WebRTC</a>
        protocol, that Internet users who watch the same video at the same time exchange
        bits of files, which relieves the server.
      - 'There is nothing to do: your web browser does it automatically. If you are
        on a mobile phone or if your network does not allow it (router, firewall,
        etc.), this function is disabled and switches back to an "old-style" video
        broadcast @:data.emoji.wink</>.'
    admin:
      title: For those who know how to administer a server, PeerTube is…
      text:
      - '<strong>It’s software you install on your server</strong> to create a website
        where videos are hosted and broadcast… Basically: you create your own "homemade
        YouTube"!'
      - There already exists free/libre software that enables you to do this. But
        with PeerTube, you can link your instance (your video website) to Zaïd’s PeerTube
        instance (where he hosts videos of the lectures for his people’s university),
        to Catherin’s (who hosts her webmedia videos) or even to Solar’s PeerTube
        instance (who manages a vloggers collective).
      - '<strong>But PeerTube doesn’t centralize: it federates.</strong> Thanks to
        the <a href="@:data.link.activitypub">ActivityPub</a> protocol (also used
        by <a href="@:data.link.mastodon">the Mastodon federation</a>, a free/libre
        Twitter alternative), PeerTube can federate several small hosters so they
        don’t have to buy thousands of hard disks to host videos for the whole world.'
      - As a result, on your PeerTube website, the audience will be able to watch
        not only your videos, but also videos hosted by Zaïd, Catherin or Solar… without
        having to host their videos on your PeerTube-powered website. Such diversity
        in a video-catalog makes it very attractive. Such a large choice and diversity
        of videos is what made centralized platforms such as YouTube succesful.
      - 'Federation offers another benefit: <strong>everyone becomes independent</strong>.
        Zaïd, Catherin, Solar and yourself can make your own rules, your own Terms
        of Services (for example, one can imagine a MeowTube where dogs videos are
        strictly forbidden @:data.emoji.wink).'
    video-maker:
      title: For those who wants to upload their videos, PeerTube allows…
      text:
      - 'It allows you to choose a hoster that fits you. YouTube’s excesses are a
        good exemple: its hoster, Google/Alphabet, can impose its "Robocopyright"
        (the ContentID system) or its tools to index, recommend and spotlight videos;
        and those tools seem as unfair as they are obscure. Even though, it already
        forces you <a href="@:data.link.tosdr">to give it extended copyrights on your
        videos, for free</a>!'
      - With PeerTube, <strong>you can choose the hoster of your videos according
        to his terms of services</strong>, his moderation policy, his federation choices…
        As you don’t have a tech giant facing you, you might be able to talk with
        you hoster if you ever have a problem, a need, or something you want.
      - The other big advantage of PeerTube is that your hoster doesn’t have to fear
        the sudden success of one of your videos. Indeed, PeerTube broadcasts videos
        with the protocol <a href="@:link.wArticle/BitTorrent">WebTorrent</a>. If
        hundreds of people are watching your video at the same time, their browsers
        automatically send bits of your video to other viewers.
      - Before this peer-to-peer broadcast, successful videographers (or videos that
        make the buzz) were doomed to be hosted by a web giant whose infrastructure
        can handle millions of simultaneous views… Or to pay for a very expensive
        independent video host so that it can hold the load.
    audience:
      title: For those who want to watch videos, PeerTube can offer…
      text:
      - One of the benefits is that <strong>you become a part of the broadcasting
        of the videos you are watching</strong>. If other people are watching a PeerTube
        video at the same time as you, as long as your tab remains open, your browser
        shares bits of that video and you participate in a healthier use of the Internet.
      - 'Of course, PeerTube’s video player adapts to your situation: if your installation
        does not allow peer-to-peer playback (corporate network, recalcitrant browser,
        etc.) video playback will be done in the classic way.'
      - But above all, <strong>PeerTube treats you like a person, not as a product</strong>
        that it has to track, profile, and lock in video loops to better sell your
        available brain time. Thus, the <a href="@:data.link.gitPT">source code</a>
        (the recipe) of the PeerTube software is open, making its operation transparent.
      - '<strong>PeerTube is not only open-source: it’s free (as in free speech).</strong>
        Its free license guarantees our fundamental freedoms as users. It is this
        respect for our freedoms that allows Framasoft to invite you to contribute
        to this software, and many evolutions (innovative comment system, etc.) have
        already been suggested by some of you.'
    remplace-yt:
      title: Is PeerTube’s purpose to replace YouTube?
      text:
      - 'We can answer with certainty: no!'
      - In March 2018, PeerTube released its publicly usable beta version. Several
        collectives set up the first instances, thus creating the bases of the federation.
      - But this is just the beginning, PeerTube is not (yet) perfect, and many features
        are missing. We intend to continue to improve it to release a version 1 by
        the end of 2018.
      - 'March 2018 thus represents the birth of the PeerTube federations: the more
        this software will be used and supported, the more people will use it and
        contribute to it, and the faster it will evolve towards a concrete alternative
        to platforms such as YouTube.'
      - 'Nevertheless, the ambition remains to be <strong>a free and decentralized
        alternative</strong>: the goal of an alternative is not to replace, but to
        propose something else, with different values, in parallel to what already
        exists.'
  content:
    law:
      title: If it’s free, can we upload illegal stuff on it?
      text:
      - Being free doesn’t mean being above the law! Each PeerTube hosting provider
        can decide on its own general conditions of use, abiding by their local laws.
      - For example, in France, discriminatory content <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_contre_le_racisme_et_les_discours_de_haine">is
        prohibited</a> and may be <a href="http://stop-discrimination.gouv.fr/agir/ne-pas-laisser-faire-les-recours">reported
        to the authorities</a>. PeerTube allows users to report problematic videos,
        and each administrator must then apply its moderation in accordance with its
        terms and conditions and the law.
      - The federation system, for its part, allows hosts to decide with whom they
        want to connect, depending on the types of content or the moderation policies
        of others.
    responsible:
      title: Who is responsible for content published on PeerTube?
      text:
      - 'PeerTube is not a website: it is software that allows a web hoster (for example,
        Dominique) to create a video website (let’s call it DominiqueTube).'
      - Now imagine that Camille has created an account on DominiqueTube and uploads
        an illegal video, because this video uses music created by Solal.
      - Solal goes on Framatube, an instance which follows DominiqueTube. So, Solal
        can see, from Framatube, the videos published on DominiqueTube.
      - Solal sees Camille’s illegal video, and signals it with the button provided
        for that purpose. Although the report is made from Framatube, it is sent directly
        to the person hosting the illegal content, Dominique.
      - From that moment on, Dominique is responsible, because they are warned that
        they’re hosting an illegal video. It is therefore up to them to act if they
        don’t want to be held accountable before the law.
      - Then Dominique and Solal can turn against Camille, who uploaded the video.
    money:
      title: What is PeerTube’s remuneration policy?
      text:
      - OrderedDict([('There are none, not at the moment', 'PeerTube is a tool that
        we wanted neutral in terms of remuneration.')])
      - 'For now, the solution proposed to people who upload videos is to use the
        "support" button under the video. This button displays a frame in which people
        who upload videos can display text, images, and links freely. For example,
        it’s possible to put a link to Patreon, Tipeee, Paypal, Liberapay (or any
        other solution) there. Other examples: put a postal address if you’d like
        to receive physical thank-you cards, put a logo of your enterprise, a link
        to support a non-profit organisation…'
      - We did not go any further because to favour one technical solution would be
        to impose, in the code, a political vision of cultural sharing and its financing.
        All financial solutions are possible and treated equally in PeerTube.
      - However, many improvements of PeerTube are to be expected… Including those
        that would allow you to create (and choose) the monetization tools that interest
        you!
      - 'Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that the vast majority of videos published
        on the Internet (and even on YouTube) are shared for non-market purposes:
        remuneration is a tool, but not necessarily a main or essential purpose.'
    instances:
      title: Where can I put my videos?
      text:
      - You need to find a PeerTube hosting instance you trust.
      - There’s a complete <a href="@:data.link.instancesPT">list of instances here</a>,
        and a list of those that are <a href="./#getting-started">open to registration
        here</a>.
      - Then, we recommend you go to the instances, read their "about" page to discover
        their terms of use (disk space limit per user, content policy, etc.).
      - It’s best to contact and talk directly with hosting providers, to understand
        their business model, vision, etc. Because only you can determine what makes
        you trust such or such host, and thus entrust your videos to them.

      text:
      - The <a href="@:data.link.gitPT/blob/develop/support/doc/production.md">installation
        guide is here</a> (only in English, for the moment).
      - 'We recommend not to install PeerTube on low-end hardware or behind a weak
        connection (for example, on a RaspberryPi with an ADSL connection): this could
        slow down all federations.'
      - 'Don’t bother the developer to help you install your instance: we have a <a
        href="@:link.forumPT">support forum</a> for that.'
    moderation:
      title: 'PeerTube v1.0 does not seem to me to contain all the tools
        necessary for a good management of my instance.'
      text:
        - '<blockquote>"It’s outrageous and unconscious: you’re releasing PeerTube’s version 1
          when it doesn’t contain the necessary tools to effectively manage videos claimed
          by rights holders, or to effectively manage the issue of online harassment in comments,
          or to effectively manage monetization through advertising, or to (insert here your
          request to PeerTube). It will never work! What do you intend to do about it?"</blockquote>'
        - 'You’re right. PeerTube 1.0 is not the perfect tool, far from it. And we never promised
          that this version 1.0 would be a tool that would include all the features corresponding
          to all cases.'
        - 'PeerTube 1.0 is the realization of the commitment we made in October 2017 to take
          PeerTube from an alpha version (personal project and proof of concept that a federated
          video platform could work) to a 1.0 version in October 2018 (which does not mean
          "final version", but "version considered stable and distributable").'
        - 'Remember that PeerTube has only one (almost) full time developer and a
          small handful of very involved volunteers. It is not a product developed by a
          start-up with a full time team (dev, design, UX, marketing, support, etc.)
          and significant financial support. It is a Community free software, the development
          of which will continue over the months and, we hope, in the years to come.'
        - 'We are well aware of the shortcomings of PeerTube 1.0, especially in the moderation
          tools area (videos, comments, etc.). And we intend to work on these weaknesses. '
        - 'We have chosen to do so as follows: on the one hand we will work primarily in
          the coming months to improve these tools within PeerTube itself (in the <i>core</i> of
          the software). On the other hand, we will also focus, in parallel, a large part
          of PeerTube’s development effort during 2019 on the integration of a plugin system,
          which can be developed by the communities.'
        - 'Indeed, we do not claim to have the science behind it and know how best to manage
          each of the tools according to each of the needs.
          For example: with regard to the question of DMCA requests, cases vary according
          to geographical jurisdictions (European law is different from French law,
          itself different from Canadian law, itself different from American law, etc.).
          Concerning the tools for moderating comments, here again, we cannot decree ourselves
          experts of the subject, because this is simply not the case.'
        - 'By acting both on the <i>core</i>, but also by allowing the development of plugins,
          we believe that PeerTube will, in the long term, be able to respond much better to
          these issues and allow different communities to adapt PeerTube to their needs.'
        - 'We are working as quickly as possible to improve PeerTube, but we are doing so with
          the resources we have, which means <strong>very</strong> limited.'
        - 'In the meantime, as an user if you feel that PeerTube 1.0 does not currently
          meet your needs, it’s simple: don’t use it right now :) (we remind you that we
          don’t make money developing PeerTube, and that if we obviously hope for its success,
          the survival of our association doesn’t depend on it).'
        - 'As an administrator, if you are afraid of DMCA requests, there is an option to limit
          the opening of registrations to people you know. You will then be able to reopen
          registrations without verification once these verification tools have been integrated,
          or you have developed them.'

    protocol:
      title: Why does PeerTube use the ActivityPub federation protocol? Why not IPFS
        / d.tube / Steemit?
      text:
      - PeerTube uses ActivityPub because this federation protocol is recommended
        by the W3C and is already used by the federated social network Mastodon.
      - IPFS is a great technology, but it still seems very (too!) young for large
        scale streaming of large files.
      - After discussing it on our forum, we feel that d.tube is not free or open
        source, because publishing only compiled code hinders freedom of modification.
      - D.tube is based on Steem for "remuneration", it is a choice, but Steem is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steemit#Criticism">widely criticized</a>
        as <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@docdelux/30-days-of-steemit-here-is-my-criticism">highly
        centralized</a>, and suspiciously <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@thecryptonews/psa-constructive-criticism-the-ugly-truth-behind-steemit">resembles
        a Ponzi system</a>.
      - PeerTube is free, decentralized, distributed, and does not impose any remuneration
        model. This is the choice we have made, which is debatable, and others (like
        d.tube) have made other choices, which have their advantages. So it’s up to
        you to see what suits you.
