          description: 'Nothing to hide (2017) is a Franco-German feature-length documentary by Marc Meillassoux and Mihaela Gladovic, about how mass surveillance affects individuals and society. Taking a critical look at the laws allowing State surveillance that were implemented by several countries in the past few years, we are reminded of how important the debate about usage of personal data is and how it questions the very basis of democracy.'

          description: 'A biopic about the story of programming prodigy and information activist Aaron Swartz. From Swartz\'s help in the development of the basic internet protocol RSS to his co-founding of Reddit, his fingerprints are all over the internet. But it was Swartz\'s groundbreaking work in social justice and political organizing combined with his aggressive approach to information access that ensnared him in a two year legal nightmare. It was a battle that ended with the taking of his own life at the age of 26. This film is a personal story about what we lose when we are tone deaf about technology and its relationship to our civil liberties.',
