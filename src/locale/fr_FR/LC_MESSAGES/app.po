"effectively manage the issue of online harassment in comments,\n"
"            or to effectively manage monetization through advertising, or to "
"(insert here your request to PeerTube). It will never work!\n"
"            What do you intend to do about it?\"\n"
"          </blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"          <p>You're right. PeerTube 1.0 is not the perfect tool, far from "
"it. And we never promised that this version 1.0 would be a\n"
"            tool that would include all the features corresponding to all "
"cases.</p>\n"
"          <p>PeerTube 1.0 is the realization of the commitment we made in "
"October 2017 to take PeerTube from an alpha version (personal\n"
"            project and proof of concept that a federated video platform "
"could work) to a 1.0 version in October 2018 (which does not mean\n"
"            \"final version\", but \"version considered stable and "
"distributable\").</p>\n"
"          <p>Remember that PeerTube has only one (almost) full time "
"developer and a small handful of very involved volunteers. It is not a\n"
"            product developed by a start-up with a full time team (dev, "
"design, UX, marketing, support, etc.) and significant financial\n"
"            support. It is a Community free software, the development of "
"which will continue over the months and, we hope, in the years to\n"
"            come.</p>\n"
"          <p>We are well aware of the shortcomings of PeerTube 1.0, "
"especially in the moderation tools area (videos, comments, etc.). And\n"
"            we intend to work on these weaknesses. </p>\n"
"          <p>We have chosen to do so as follows: on the one hand we will "
"work primarily in the coming months to improve these tools within\n"
"            PeerTube itself (in the <i>core</i> of the software). On the "
"other hand, we will also focus, in parallel, a large part of\n"
"            PeerTube's development effort during 2019 on the integration of "
"a plugin system, which can be developed by the communities.\n"
"          </p>\n"
"          <p>Indeed, we do not claim to have the science behind it and know "
"how best to manage each of the tools according to each of the\n"
"            needs. For example: with regard to the question of DMCA "
"requests, cases vary according to geographical jurisdictions (European\n"
"            law is different from French law, itself different from Canadian "
"law, itself different from American law, etc.). Concerning\n"
"            the tools for moderating comments, here again, we cannot decree "
"ourselves experts of the subject, because this is simply not\n"
"            the case.</p>\n"
"          <p>By acting both on the <i>core</i>, but also by allowing the "
"development of plugins, we believe that PeerTube will, in the\n"
"            long term, be able to respond much better to these issues and "
"allow different communities to adapt PeerTube to their needs.\n"
"          </p>\n"
"          <p>We are working as quickly as possible to improve PeerTube, but "
"we are doing so with the resources we have, which means\n"
"            <strong>very</strong> limited.</p>\n"
"          <p>In the meantime, as an user if you feel that PeerTube 1.0 does "
"not currently meet your needs, it's simple: don't use it right\n"
"            now :) (we remind you that we don't make money developing "
"PeerTube, and that if we obviously hope for its success, the\n"
"            survival of our association doesn't depend on it).</p>\n"
"          <p>As an administrator, if you are afraid of DMCA requests, there "
"is an option to limit the opening of registrations to people\n"
"            you know. You will then be able to reopen registrations without "
"verification once these verification tools have been\n"
"            integrated, or you have developed them.</p>"

"          <p>There already exists free/libre software that enables you to do "
