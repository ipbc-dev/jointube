With this new player, resolution changes should be smoother and the bandwidth management is optimized with a more efficient buffering system. Version 1.3 of PeerTube also adds ability for administrators to enable this new experimental player so we can get feedback on it. We hope to use this new player by default in the future.":"Nous sommes aussi en train de retravailler le <strong>lecteur vidéo de PeerTube</strong> afin que la lecture des vidéos soit plus rapide et comporte moins de bugs. Ce nouveau lecteur vidéo permet aussi de rendre plus lisses les changements de définition.

Cette version 1.3 de PeerTube permet à l'administrateur d'activer ce nouveau lecteur vidéo expérimental afin pour nous de récolter des retours dessus.
