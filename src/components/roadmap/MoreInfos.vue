            At a time when no one knows what the future will bring, it didn't seem decent for us to do a crowdfunding campaign
            threatening to not do our best on PeerTube if we didn't raise the necessary funds.
          </p>

          <p v-translate>
            We believe in the public utility of PeerTube, so much so that we commit to work on it for six months to make this v3 happen,
            even if we must do it on our own funds
            (which <a href="https://framablog.org/2019/11/12/peertube-has-worked-twice-as-hard-to-free-your-videos-from-youtube/">we had already done for v2</a>).
          </p>

          <p v-translate>
            We still hope that by sharing this roadmap as widely as possible,
            some of you will support us in our approach with a donation that will allow us to fund this work.

            <a href="https://instances.joinpeertube.org/">the public directory</a>.</p>

            use one of these indexing engines for their instance's search bar</strong> de son instance.</p>

            <p>In addition, <strong>announcements</strong>

            href="https://joinpeertube.org/faq#peertube-developers-did-not-add-moderation-tools">new moderation features</a>,
            there is still much to be done to <strong>facilitate moderation</strong> of content and accounts in the federation.
            That's why we want to <strong>dedicate a month of development to new moderation tools</strong>.</p>

            <p>The list of functionalities to develop or improve is long: reports logs and monitoring, moderation history,
            comments moderation, moderation reports related to an account, feedback on steps taken (or not) following a report,
            <strong>fight against spam</strong>, sharing blacklists of instances, accounts or content...</p>

            <p>This list is being built

            We want to rework the <strong>embed and display of playlists</strong> on third party sites.</p>

            <p>We also want to <strong>allow two clips of the same video to be displayed in a playlist</strong>. Combined with the ability to
            extract a specific piece of video in a playlist, playlists will thus become very useful remixing tools,
            for example for educational purposes.</p>

            <p>Plugins allow anyone to contribute new features to PeerTube by coding them into PeerTube, and offer them to instance

            <p>By using the HLS technology that has been built into the PeerTube video player since version 1.3, we believe
